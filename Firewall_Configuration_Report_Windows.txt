Task 4: Setup and Use a Firewall on Windows


System Used: Microsoft Windows
Firewall Tool: Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security

Objective:
----------
To configure and test basic firewall rules to allow or block traffic on Windows using the built-in firewall settings.

Steps Performed:
----------------
1. Opened Windows Defender Firewall â†’ Advanced Settings.
2. Created an Inbound Rule to block Telnet (Port 23):
   - Rule Type: Port
   - Protocol: TCP
   - Port: 23
   - Action: Block the connection
   - Applied to: Domain, Private, Public
   - Name: Block Telnet Port 23

3. Created an Inbound Rule to allow SSH (Port 22):
   - Rule Type: Port
   - Protocol: TCP
   - Port: 22
   - Action: Allow the connection
   - Name: Allow SSH Port 22

4. Verified active rules and confirmed rule behavior.
5. Deleted the Telnet block rule after testing.

Summary:
--------
- Successfully applied and tested inbound rules using Windows Firewall.
- Telnet was blocked (port 23), preventing insecure remote access.
- SSH remained open for secure communications (port 22).

Firewall Key Concepts:
-----------------------
- Firewalls filter traffic based on port numbers and direction (inbound/outbound).
- Port 23 (Telnet) is insecure and should be blocked.
- Port 22 (SSH) is secure and should be allowed if required.
- Stateful firewalls track active connections to allow smarter filtering.
